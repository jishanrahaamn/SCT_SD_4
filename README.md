#Product Information Scraper

Project Description
This Web Scraper is a tool that retrieves product information from an online store (or API) and displays it in a table format on a webpage. Additionally, it provides an option to download the scraped data as a CSV file, making it easy to view and analyze the data offline. The scraper can fetch details such as product name, price, and rating for each item.

This project is useful for anyone looking to extract product data from e-commerce sites or APIs for analysis, comparison, or storage.
